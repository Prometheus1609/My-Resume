    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I'm a highly motivated and results-driven professional with 11 years of experience in the field of civil protection. With a 
        strong backround in this area, i have consistently demonstrated a track of record of success in accomplishing every 
        mission that i was assigned to. Web Programming and Development was my unfulfilled dream until now, because i 
        believe that it's never too late to work on something that you love. I'm a self-motivated person with exceptional 
        communication, organization, time managing and creativity skills, but the attributes that i'm best known for are 
        teamwork and honesty. I'm eager to put all my passion in a project in order to achieve success.
